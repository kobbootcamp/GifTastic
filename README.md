The challenge for this project is to display ten gifs and gif ratings based on the animal button that is clicked.  
Example: display ten chicken gifs when the chicken button is clicked.
The gifs must start paused, and start playing when the user clicks the gif.  The gif should stop playing if the user clicks the gif again.
The user can add animals of his/her.  Type an animal in the "Add an animal" box, and the that animal will have a button of its own.
Click on the newly created animal button, and ten gifs related to that animal will appear.
